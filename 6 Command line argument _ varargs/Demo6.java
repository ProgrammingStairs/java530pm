/*
    static keyword : 
----------------
    a. Block
    b. Variable 
    c. Method 
    d. Class

a. Block : 
static block executes only one time when the class loads.
static block executes before main method. 

b. Variable : 
static variable are also known as class variable.

static variable gets memory only one time.

If we make any variable as a static, then in that case we do not need class object to access that specific static variable, static variables are directly accessible by class name. 

c. Method : 
For making any method as a static, then in that case we use static keyword followed by method name. 

If we make any method as a static, then in that case, we do not need class object to call that static method, static methods are directly called by class name.

Note : 
For making any variable as a static, then in that case we use static keyword followed by variable name.
